# Outlier Detection and Handling

## Description
This step involves visualizing outliers for each target, using IQR and z-score methods to detect and remove outliers, and creating separate datasets with and without outliers.

## Tools Used
- Python for outlier detection and handling.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

## Scripts
- `src/detect_outliers.py`: Visualizes outliers, detects and removes outliers using IQR and z-score methods, and creates separate datasets.

## Key Findings
- Outliers were visualized using boxplots, violin plots, and scatter plots.
- IQR and z-score methods were used to detect and remove outliers.
- Separate datasets were created with and without outliers.
- The impact of outlier removal was visualized.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with correlation and feature analysis.
