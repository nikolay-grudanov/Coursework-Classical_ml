# Residual Analysis & Error Diagnostics

## Description
This step involves plotting residuals for each top-performing regression and classification model, analyzing their distributions, identifying patterns or trends, providing statistical summaries of errors, and visualizing the spread of errors using histograms, boxplots, and QQ-plots. For classification, confusion matrices are shown and misclassified samples are analyzed.

## Tools Used
- Python for residual analysis and error diagnostics.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- Scikit-learn for confusion matrices.

## Scripts
- `src/residual_analysis.py`: Plots residuals, analyzes distributions, identifies patterns, provides statistical summaries, and visualizes the spread of errors.

## Key Findings
- Residuals were plotted for each top-performing regression and classification model.
- Distributions of residuals were analyzed.
- Patterns or trends in residuals were identified.
- Statistical summaries of errors were provided.
- Spread of errors was visualized using histograms, boxplots, and QQ-plots.
- Confusion matrices were shown for classification models, and misclassified samples were analyzed.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with feature importance and model interpretation.
