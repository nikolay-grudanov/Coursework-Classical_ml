# Feature Importance & Model Interpretation

## Description
This step involves plotting and discussing feature importances for tree-based models, analyzing coefficients for linear models, using SHAP for advanced feature contribution analysis, and summarizing the most influential features for each target.

## Tools Used
- Python for feature importance and model interpretation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- Scikit-learn for feature importances and coefficients.
- SHAP for advanced feature contribution analysis.

## Scripts
- `src/feature_importance.py`: Plots and discusses feature importances, analyzes coefficients, uses SHAP, and summarizes the most influential features.

## Key Findings
- Feature importances were plotted and discussed for tree-based models.
- Coefficients were analyzed for linear models.
- SHAP was used for advanced feature contribution analysis.
- Most influential features were summarized for each target.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with data subgroup analysis.
