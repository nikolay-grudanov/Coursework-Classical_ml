# Evaluation and Analysis

## Description
This step involves evaluating the performance of the regression and classification models and analyzing the results.

## Tools Used
- Python for evaluation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation metrics.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

## Scripts
- `src/regression_models.py`: Evaluates the regression models.
- `src/classification_models.py`: Evaluates the classification models.

## Summary of Decisions and Results
- The regression models showed moderate performance with R2 values indicating the proportion of variance explained.
- The classification models, after addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and using Random Forest, showed improved accuracy and balanced performance across classes.
- The `CC50` classification model performed the best among the classification tasks.

## Next Steps
- Create a final report summarizing the findings and conclusions.
