# Advanced Visualizations and Insights

## Description
This step involves creating advanced visualizations such as pair plots, histograms with KDE, and scatter matrices for targets, analyzing class imbalances for classification tasks, performing PCA for dimensionality reduction visualization, and conducting statistical tests.

## Tools Used
- Python for advanced visualizations and statistical tests.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for visualization and analysis.

## Scripts
- `src/advanced_visualizations.py`: Creates advanced visualizations, analyzes class imbalances, performs PCA, and conducts statistical tests.

## Key Findings
- Advanced visualizations were created for targets.
- Class imbalances for classification tasks were analyzed.
- PCA was performed for dimensionality reduction visualization.
- Statistical tests were conducted to check significance.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with data preparation for machine learning.
