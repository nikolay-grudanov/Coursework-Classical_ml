# Correlation and Feature Analysis

## Description
This step involves computing and visualizing correlation heatmaps for all features vs. targets, removing features with NaN correlations or high multicollinearity, and identifying potential feature engineering opportunities.

## Tools Used
- Python for correlation analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

## Scripts
- `src/correlation_analysis.py`: Computes and visualizes correlation heatmaps, removes features with NaN correlations or high multicollinearity, and identifies potential feature engineering opportunities.

## Key Findings
- Correlation heatmaps were computed and visualized for all features vs. targets.
- Features with NaN correlations or high multicollinearity were removed.
- Potential feature engineering opportunities were identified.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with advanced visualizations and insights.
