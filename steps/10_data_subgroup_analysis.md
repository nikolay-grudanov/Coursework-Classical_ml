# Data Subgroup Analysis

## Description
This step involves investigating how model quality and errors differ across key data subgroups and visualizing the performance by subgroup.

## Tools Used
- Python for data subgroup analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

## Scripts
- `src/data_subgroup_analysis.py`: Investigates model quality and errors by subgroup and visualizes performance.

## Key Findings
- Model quality and errors were investigated across key data subgroups.
- Performance was visualized by subgroup.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with insight extraction and recommendations.
