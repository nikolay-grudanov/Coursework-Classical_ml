# Exploratory Data Analysis Report

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 1,000 chemical compounds with features representing their chemical properties and effectiveness metrics:

- **IC50**: Half maximal inhibitory concentration (lower is better)
- **CC50**: Half maximal cytotoxic concentration (higher is better)
- **SI**: Selectivity index (CC50/IC50, higher is better)

## Data Structure

The dataset contains 214 columns:
- 1 index column (Unnamed: 0)
- 3 target variables (IC50, CC50, SI)
- 4 derived binary targets for classification
- 206 molecular descriptor features

## Statistical Summary

After cleaning the data:
- Removed the unnecessary 'Unnamed: 0' column
- Handled missing values by filling with median values
- Created binary classification targets:
  - IC50_above_median: compounds with IC50 above the median value
  - CC50_above_median: compounds with CC50 above the median value
  - SI_above_median: compounds with SI above the median value
  - SI_above_8: compounds with SI above 8 (clinically significant threshold)

## Data Quality

- Missing values were detected and filled with median values for numerical stability
- All features are numerical, which simplifies preprocessing
- Features represent molecular descriptors from RDKit, which are standardized chemical feature representations

## Target Distributions

### Regression Targets
1. **IC50 distribution**: 
   - Range: [min_value] to [max_value]
   - Mean: [mean_value]
   - Standard deviation: [std_value]

2. **CC50 distribution**: 
   - Range: [min_value] to [max_value]
   - Mean: [mean_value]
   - Standard deviation: [std_value]

3. **SI distribution**: 
   - Range: [min_value] to [max_value]
   - Mean: [mean_value]
   - Standard deviation: [std_value]

### Classification Targets
1. **IC50 > median**: [class_distribution]
2. **CC50 > median**: [class_distribution]
3. **SI > median**: [class_distribution]
4. **SI > 8**: [class_distribution]

## Feature Analysis

Key observations from preliminary feature analysis:
- High-dimensional feature space (206 features) requires careful model selection
- Some features may be highly correlated, suggesting potential for dimensionality reduction
- Feature distributions vary significantly, indicating the need for scaling in some models

## Data Splitting Strategy

To ensure reproducible results and prevent data leakage:
- Used stratified splitting for classification tasks to maintain class distribution
- Applied the same random seed (42) across all splits for consistency
- Reserved 20% of data for testing, with 80% for training/validation

## Outlier Detection

Potential outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:
- [number] outliers detected in IC50
- [number] outliers detected in CC50
- [number] outliers detected in SI

## Conclusions

The dataset is well-structured for machine learning tasks with:
1. Adequate sample size (1,000 compounds) for the feature dimensionality
2. Clear target variables relevant to drug effectiveness
3. Proper preprocessing to handle missing data
4. Balanced approach to train/test splitting

The next steps involve training multiple models for each task to identify the best performing approaches.
