# Rules and Initial Plan

## Rules
- Always include the language and file name in the info string when you write code blocks.
- Use the `think-mcp` tool for planning and reasoning before performing any operations.
- Use the `unichat-with-codestral-mcp-server_unichat` tool for generating and optimizing code, as well as for finding new ideas.
- Request and learn the rules using `request_rule` to ensure compliance with guidelines.
- Follow the standards and principles described in the rules.

## Initial Plan
1. **Explore the Project Structure**: List the files in the project directory to understand what we have.
2. **Understand the Data**: Locate the data file (`data.xlsx`) and read it to understand its structure.
3. **Plan for EDA**: Check for missing values, outliers, and distributions of the features.
4. **Plan for Modeling**: Identify the types of models we will build (regression and classification).
5. **Request Rules**: Request the rules for the coursework to ensure we follow the guidelines.
6. **Document Everything**: Create markdown files in `steps` to document each stage of the process.
