# Data Preparation for ML

## Description
This step involves normalizing/scaling features, creating separate datasets for regression/classification, handling class imbalance using SMOTE if needed, and splitting into train/test sets.

## Tools Used
- Python for data preparation.
- Scikit-learn for normalization, scaling, and train/test splitting.
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance.

## Scripts
- `src/prepare_data.py`: Normalizes/scales features, creates separate datasets, handles class imbalance, and splits into train/test sets.

## Key Findings
- Features were normalized/scaled.
- Separate datasets were created for regression/classification.
- Class imbalance was handled using SMOTE if needed.
- Data was split into train/test sets.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with summary and recommendations.
