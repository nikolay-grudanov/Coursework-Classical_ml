# Data Loading and Initial Inspection

## Description
This step involves loading the dataset using Pandas and performing an initial inspection to understand its structure and contents.

## Tools Used
- Python for data loading and inspection.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

## Scripts
- `src/load_data.py`: Loads the data and performs initial inspection.

## Key Findings
- The dataset contains 1001 entries and 214 columns.
- Key target variables include `IC50, mM`, `CC50, mM`, and `SI`.
- Basic statistics and distributions for the targets and key features were computed and visualized.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with data cleaning and handling missing values.
